		I am a qualitative researcher exploring <strong> the interrelation of digital technologies and social life</strong>, drawing on Feminist Science and Technology Studies, Critical HCI, Education, Communication, and Information Studies. My dissertation, <em>Blank Slate: Freedom, Connection, and Accountability in U.S. Virtual Schools</em>, supervised by <a href="https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~jenna/">Professor Jenna Burrell</a>, uses ethnographic methods to investigate the experiences of teachers, students, and families in U.S. based online schools and the role of these institutions in a larger school choice landscape and increasingly digitized workforce structured by social inequality. I am currently a <a href="https://cifellows2021.org/2021-class/"> Computing Innovation Fellow</a> working with <a href="https://jean.lgbt/">Professor Jean Hardy</a> at Michigan State University.
	</p>
	<p>At the UC Berkeley School of Information, I designed and taught a graduate seminar, "<a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/290/fsn">Ethnographies of the Digital</a>," and served as a graduate student instructor for the core masters program course "<a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/203">Social Issues of Information</a>." From August 2018 - August 2020 I was the Co-Director of the <a href="https://ctsp.berkeley.edu/">Center for Technology, Society &amp; Policy</a>. I have been a student research awardee of the <a href="http://irle.berkeley.edu/">Institute for Research on Labor and Employment</a> and a Research Grantee of the <a href="https://cltc.berkeley.edu/2017grantees/">Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity</a> on several collaborative projects. In graduate school, I was a member of the <a href="https://afog.berkeley.edu/" >Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group</a> and the <a href="https://biosense.berkeley.edu/">Biosense Initiative</a>, and completed a <a href="https://cstms.berkeley.edu/teaching/de-in-sts/">Designated Emphasis in Science and Technology Studies</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I graduated from the Chicago Public Schools and Brown University, where I studied English Literature and cultural theory with a focus on gender and sexuality. After college, I worked with <a href="https://www.glsen.org" >GLSEN</a> on communications and research into school safety for LGBTQ+ and GNC students, and with Parliamentarians for Global Action on a summit of leaders pursuing sustainable environmental policies. I next spent two and a half years at the <a href="https://pculture.org" >Participatory Culture Foundation</a>, first as an Americorps VISTA and then as a Program Director, focusing on partnerships with local media and educational organizations to create open-source curated community video websites. Prior to graduate school, I worked as the&nbsp;Program Manager at the <a href="https://bcrw.barnard.edu" >Barnard Center for Research on Women</a>, where I produced events and materials around social justice feminism, including co-organizing the "<a href="http://bcrw.barnard.edu/event/action-on-education/" >Action on Education</a>" conference and acting as an interim managing editor for the&nbsp;<i><a href="http://sfonline.barnard.edu/">Scholar &amp; Feminist Online</a></i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I enjoy running, hiking, learning about new places, reading, and television.
